## About Me

Hi there! I’m Ce Zhang and I’m currently pursuing my Master's degree in Machine Learning at CMU and looking forward to graduating in December 2024. Before this, I earned my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). My current research interest lie in vision-language models and scene understanding.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** vision-language models, scene understanding
- **Machine Learning:** multi-modal machine learning, transfer learning
