## About Me

Hi there! I’m Ce Zhang, a master’s student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Zhihai He](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhihaihe.html). My current research interest lie in vision-language models and scene understanding.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** vision-language models, scene understanding
- **Machine Learning:** multi-modal machine learning, transfer learning
