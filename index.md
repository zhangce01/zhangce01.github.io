## About Me

Hi there! I'm Ce Zhang. I will be joining the Ph.D. in Robotics program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Fall 2025.

Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Machine Learning in the Machine Learning Department at CMU, advised by [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Zhihai He](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhihaihe.html). My current research interest lie in vision-language models and scene understanding.

## Research Interests

I aim to enhance the adaptability and reliability of multi-modal models, pushing the boundaries of what they can achieve in real-world applications. My vision focuses on tackling pivotal challenges, including:
- **How can we responsibly deploy multi-modal models while mitigating real-world societal concerns**, such as mitigating misinformation and hallucinations, promoting fairness, and overcoming challenges with compositional reasoning?
- **How can we enable a broader adaptability of these models to diverse real-world domains**, such as robotics and healthcare, by leveraging resource-efficient fine-tuning, test-time adaptation, and continual learning?
- **How can these models seamlessly interact with humans and their environments**, such as advancing capabilities in human-object interaction detection, 3D visual reasoning, and video understanding?
