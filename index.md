## About Me

Hi there! I’m Ce Zhang and I’m currently pursuing my Master's degree in Machine Learning at CMU and looking forward to graduating in December 2024. Before this, I earned my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). My current research interest lie in vision-language models and scene understanding.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** vision-language models, scene understanding
- **Machine Learning:** multi-modal machine learning, transfer learning

## News

- **[Sep. 2023]** Our paper "Critical Sampling for Robust Evolution Operator Learning of Unknown Dynamical Systems" is accepted to IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence.
- **[Aug. 2023]** Our paper "BDC-Adapter: Brownian Distance Covariance for Better Vision-Language Reasoning" is accepted to BMVC 2023.
- **[Jun. 2023]** I am awarded the Top 10 Summa Cum Laude Graduates by Southern University of Science and Technology.
